# Project Summary
Palimpsest is a collaborative text analysis tool designed to enhance documentation and file management within team environments. It aims to streamline workflows by providing efficient access to project files, ensuring that all team members are informed and aligned. The project is currently focused on developing a P0-stage prototype that emphasizes effective text processing and analysis, utilizing advanced techniques in natural language processing and data visualization.

# Project Module Description
The Palimpsest project comprises various modules that facilitate file management, team collaboration, and documentation review. Each module is tailored to support specific tasks related to the project's overall objectives, including:
- **StringMatchingModule**: Implements exact and fuzzy string matching.
- **SemanticAnalysisModule**: Handles semantic similarity computations and document embedding generation.
- **SyntacticAnalysisModule**: Performs grammatical analysis and extracts linguistic patterns.
- **StructuralAnalysisModule**: Analyzes document structure and identifies narrative elements.
