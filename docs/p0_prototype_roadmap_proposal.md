# P0-Prototype Roadmap Proposal

## Overview
This proposal outlines the roadmap for developing the P0-stage prototype of the Palimpsest text analysis tool. The roadmap is based on the review of system design, implementation plan, and research documents.

## Key Phases

### Phase 1: Core Framework and Foundational Components
- **Duration**: 5 weeks
- **Tasks**:
  - Set up project structure and development environment
  - Implement basic data models and document import/export functionality
  - Establish core API structure
  - Implement StringMatchingModule and SemanticAnalysisModule

### Phase 2: Advanced Analysis Modules
- **Duration**: 8 weeks
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement SyntacticAnalysisModule and StructuralAnalysisModule
  - Develop visualization components

### Phase 3: Integration and P0 Prototype
- **Duration**: 6 weeks
- **Tasks**:
  - Integrate all modules and APIs
  - Develop frontend components
  - Conduct testing and deployment

## Technical Dependencies
- **Libraries**:
  - `spaCy`, `NLTK`, `sentence-transformers` for NLP
  - `React`, `Tailwind CSS` for frontend
  - `D3.js`, `plotly.js` for visualization

## Risk Assessment
- **Performance with Large Documents**: Mitigation through incremental analysis and efficient algorithms
- **Integration Complexity**: Mitigation through clear interfaces and comprehensive integration tests

## Conclusion
This roadmap provides a structured approach to developing the P0-stage prototype of Palimpsest. By following the outlined phases and addressing key risks, we aim to deliver a functional prototype that meets the project's goals.
