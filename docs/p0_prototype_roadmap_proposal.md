# P0-Prototype Roadmap Proposal

## Overview

This proposal presents a clear roadmap for developing the P0-stage prototype of the Palimpsest text analysis tool. It is informed by comprehensive reviews of system design, implementation plans, and research documents.

## Key Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Framework and Foundational Components

- **Duration**: 5 weeks (estimated - ongoing)
- **Tasks**:
  - [x] Set up project structure and development environment
  - [x] Implement basic data models and document import/export functionality
  - [x] Establish core API structure
  - [x] Implement StringMatchingModule (initial version - needs refactor)
  - [x] Implement SemanticAnalysisModule (initial version)

**Phase 1 - Status Update**: Phase 1 is mostly complete, with initial versions of core modules and API endpoints implemented. We are now in the process of refactoring and improving these foundational components.

### Phase 2: Advanced Analysis Modules and Refactoring

- **Duration**: 8 weeks (estimated - adjusted)
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Refactor StringMatchingModule into separate analysis and visualization scripts, following the 8-step workflow.
  - [ ] Implement SyntacticAnalysisModule
  - [ ] Implement StructuralAnalysisModule
  - [ ] Develop visualization components for String Matching (Heatmap, Circos-style plots)
  - [ ] Develop visualization components for Semantic Analysis and other modules

**Phase 2 - Status Update**: We have started the refactoring of the String Matching Module. Work is in progress to modularize the analysis and visualization components. Further development of Syntactic and Structural Analysis Modules and advanced visualizations will follow.

### Phase 3: Integration and P0 Prototype

- **Duration**: 6 weeks (estimated)
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Integrate all modules and APIs
  - [ ] Develop and refine frontend components (UI)
  - [ ] Conduct testing and deployment
  - [ ] Address UI issues возникшие during recent code changes.

**Phase 3 - Status Update**: Integration and UI development will commence after the refactoring of core analysis modules is further advanced and UI issues are resolved.

## Technical Requirements

- **Libraries**:
  - `spaCy`, `NLTK`, `sentence-transformers` for NLP
  - `React`, `Tailwind CSS` for frontend (currently using basic HTML/CSS/JS for P0 prototype)
  - `D3.js`, `plotly.js` for visualization (for future enhancements)
  - `pandas` for data manipulation in analysis modules

## Risk Management

- **Performance with Large Documents**: Mitigation through incremental analysis and efficient algorithms (addressed in refactoring plan)
- **Integration Complexity**: Mitigation through clear interfaces and comprehensive integration tests (ongoing focus)
- **LLM API Rate Limits**: Mitigation strategies need to be considered for future development to handle potential rate limits from LLM APIs.

## Final Thoughts

This roadmap provides a structured approach to developing the P0-stage prototype of Palimpsest. We are currently focused on Phase 2, modularizing and refactoring the analysis modules, starting with String Matching. Addressing UI issues and considering API rate limits are also important aspects for the next development steps.

## Recommendations

- **Additional Testing**: Consider adding a phase for user testing and feedback collection to refine the prototype (planned for later phases).
- **Scalability Considerations**: Ensure that the architecture can handle increased data loads as the project scales (addressed in design and refactoring).
- **Documentation**: Include comprehensive documentation for each module to facilitate future development and maintenance (ongoing - documentation will be updated as modules are refactored).
  - **Resource Allocation**: Ensure adequate resources are allocated for each phase to avoid bottlenecks and delays (ongoing monitoring).
  - **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback loop with stakeholders to continuously improve the prototype based on user input (in place - user feedback is actively incorporated).
  - **Final Review**: Conduct a final review of the roadmap to ensure all suggestions and edits have been incorporated effectively (planned for end of P0 prototype development).
