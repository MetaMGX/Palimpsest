001|# P0-Prototype Roadmap Proposal
002|
003|## Overview
004|This proposal outlines the roadmap for developing the P0-stage prototype of the Palimpsest text analysis tool. The roadmap is based on the review of system design, implementation plan, and research documents.
005|
006|## Key Phases
007|
008|### Phase 1: Core Framework and Foundational Components
009|- **Duration**: 5 weeks
010|- **Tasks**:
011|  - Set up project structure and development environment
012|  - Implement basic data models and document import/export functionality
013|  - Establish core API structure
014|  - Implement StringMatchingModule and SemanticAnalysisModule
015|
016|### Phase 2: Advanced Analysis Modules
017|- **Duration**: 8 weeks
018|- **Tasks**:
019|  - Implement SyntacticAnalysisModule and StructuralAnalysisModule
020|  - Develop visualization components
021|
022|### Phase 3: Integration and P0 Prototype
023|- **Duration**: 6 weeks
024|- **Tasks**:
025|  - Integrate all modules and APIs
026|  - Develop frontend components
027|  - Conduct testing and deployment
028|
029|## Technical Dependencies
030|- **Libraries**:
031|  - `spaCy`, `NLTK`, `sentence-transformers` for NLP
032|  - `React`, `Tailwind CSS` for frontend
033|  - `D3.js`, `plotly.js` for visualization
034|
035|## Risk Assessment
036|- **Performance with Large Documents**: Mitigation through incremental analysis and efficient algorithms
037|- **Integration Complexity**: Mitigation through clear interfaces and comprehensive integration tests
038|
039|## Conclusion
040|This roadmap provides a structured approach to developing the P0-stage prototype of Palimpsest. By following the outlined phases and addressing key risks, we aim to deliver a functional prototype that meets the project's goals.

042|## Suggestions
043|- **Additional Testing**: Consider adding a phase for user testing and feedback collection to refine the prototype.
044|- **Scalability Considerations**: Ensure that the architecture can handle increased data loads as the project scales.
045|- **Documentation**: Include comprehensive documentation for each module to facilitate future development and maintenance.
046|  - **Resource Allocation**: Ensure adequate resources are allocated for each phase to avoid bottlenecks and delays.
047|  - **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback loop with stakeholders to continuously improve the prototype based on user input.
048|  - **Final Review**: Conduct a final review of the roadmap to ensure all suggestions and edits have been incorporated effectively.
