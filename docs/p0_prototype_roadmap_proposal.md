# P0-Prototype Roadmap Proposal

## Overview

This proposal presents a clear roadmap for developing the P0-stage prototype of the Palimpsest text analysis tool. It is informed by comprehensive reviews of system design, implementation plans, and research documents.

## Key Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Framework and Foundational Components

- **Duration**: 5 weeks
- **Tasks**:
  - Set up project structure and development environment
  - Implement basic data models and document import/export functionality
  - Establish core API structure
  - Implement StringMatchingModule and SemanticAnalysisModule

### Phase 2: Advanced Analysis Modules

- **Duration**: 8 weeks
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement SyntacticAnalysisModule and StructuralAnalysisModule
  - Develop visualization components

### Phase 3: Integration and P0 Prototype

- **Duration**: 6 weeks
- **Tasks**:
  - Integrate all modules and APIs
  - Develop frontend components
  - Conduct testing and deployment

## Technical Requirements

- **Libraries**:
  - `spaCy`, `NLTK`, `sentence-transformers` for NLP
  - `React`, `Tailwind CSS` for frontend
  - `D3.js`, `plotly.js` for visualization

## Risk Management

- **Performance with Large Documents**: Mitigation through incremental analysis and efficient algorithms
- **Integration Complexity**: Mitigation through clear interfaces and comprehensive integration tests

## Final Thoughts

This roadmap provides a structured approach to developing the P0-stage prototype of Palimpsest. By following the outlined phases and addressing key risks, we aim to deliver a functional prototype that meets the project's goals.

## Recommendations

- **Additional Testing**: Consider adding a phase for user testing and feedback collection to refine the prototype.
- **Scalability Considerations**: Ensure that the architecture can handle increased data loads as the project scales.
- **Documentation**: Include comprehensive documentation for each module to facilitate future development and maintenance.
  - **Resource Allocation**: Ensure adequate resources are allocated for each phase to avoid bottlenecks and delays.
  - **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback loop with stakeholders to continuously improve the prototype based on user input.
  - **Final Review**: Conduct a final review of the roadmap to ensure all suggestions and edits have been incorporated effectively.
