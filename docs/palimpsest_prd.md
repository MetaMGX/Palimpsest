# Product Requirements Document: Palimpsest

## Language & Project Info

- **Language**: English
- **Programming Language**: React, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS for frontend; Python for backend processing
- **Project Name**: palimpsest
- **Original Requirements**: Create a software tool (Palimpsest) that can compare very long text documents with each other (for example: The Bible and The Book of Mormon) or with themselves (for example: The Federalist Papers) to look for patterns of similarities and differences in multiple conceptual dimensions. The tool will perform global-level analyses for comparing up to four "large" documents, run statistical tests of comparison, and present interactive visuals for textual exploration.

## Product Definition

### Product Goals

1. **Enable Advanced Multi-Dimensional Text Comparison**: Create a platform that allows researchers, academics, and literary professionals to analyze and visualize similarities and differences between large texts across multiple dimensions (lexical, semantic, syntactic, structural).

2. **Democratize Computational Literary Analysis**: Make sophisticated text analysis techniques accessible to users without advanced technical skills through intuitive interfaces and visualizations.

3. **Facilitate New Insights in Comparative Literature**: Provide analytical capabilities that reveal previously undetected patterns, influences, and relationships between texts to advance literary scholarship and understanding.

### User Stories

2. **As a** literary researcher, **I want to** analyze structural and thematic similarities between epic literary works **so that** I can trace influences and evolutions across literary traditions.

3. **As a** linguistics professor, **I want to** perform syntactic pattern analysis across multiple translated versions of classical texts **so that** I can demonstrate how translation affects meaning and structure.

4. **As a** digital humanities student, **I want to** create interactive visualizations of textual relationships **so that** I can effectively present my research findings in an engaging manner.

5. **As a** content analyst, **I want to** compare different editions of historically significant documents **so that** I can track how ideas and language evolved over multiple revisions.

## Genomic Analysis Inspiration

A study of genomic comparison software reveals powerful techniques that can be adapted for Palimpsest's text analysis capabilities. This section explores these techniques and how they can enhance our product.

### Applicable Genomic Analysis Techniques

#### 1. Sequence Alignment Algorithms
Genome browsers like JBrowse 2 and IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer) implement sophisticated sequence alignment algorithms that can be adapted for text comparison:

- **Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)**: These algorithms align multiple textual sequences simultaneously, revealing shared patterns and divergences.
- **Local vs. Global Alignment**: Different strategies optimize for finding either complete document-level similarities or localized matches.
- **Progressive Alignment**: Can be adapted to iteratively build text comparisons, starting with the most similar sections.

#### 2. Advanced Visualization Approaches
Genomic visualization tools offer sophisticated techniques for representing complex relationships:

- **Multi-level Visualization**: Tools like HiGlass demonstrate effective navigation between macro and micro views, applicable to large text corpora.
- **Interactive Track-Based Views**: Genome browsers use parallel tracks to show multiple data dimensions simultaneously.
- **Heat Maps and Color Gradients**: Used in genomic analysis to represent similarity/difference intensity.

#### 3. Pattern Detection Methods
Genomic tools employ advanced algorithms for detecting significant patterns:

- **Motif Finding**: Algorithms that identify recurring patterns in genomic data can be adapted to find literary motifs, repeated structures, or thematic patterns.
- **Variant Analysis**: Techniques for identifying significant variations can be applied to detect unique textual features or divergent passages.

#### 4. Performance Optimization Techniques
Bioinformatics tools have developed specialized approaches for handling extremely large datasets:

- **Indexing Strategies**: Genomic tools utilize sophisticated indexing for rapid querying of massive datasets.
- **Progressive Loading**: Visualization tools like IGV implement dynamic loading of detail only when needed.
- **Parallel Processing**: Genomic analysis typically leverages specialized algorithms optimized for parallel execution.

### Integration into Palimpsest

We will incorporate these genomic analysis inspirations into Palimpsest:

1. **Enhanced Alignment Algorithms**: Adapt MSA algorithms to improve Palimpsest's string matching capabilities, allowing for more sensitive detection of related passages.

2. **Multi-level Visualization Interface**: Implement a track-based visualization system inspired by genome browsers that allows users to view multiple analysis dimensions simultaneously.

3. **Advanced Pattern Detection**: Incorporate motif-finding algorithms to automatically identify recurring structural or thematic elements across texts.

4. **Optimized Performance**: Apply bioinformatics-inspired indexing and parallel processing strategies to efficiently handle very large documents.

5. **Syntactic Structure Visualization**: Adapt chromosome visualization techniques to represent the syntactic structure of texts, enabling visual comparison of grammatical patterns.

### Updated Requirements

1. **Bioinformatics-Inspired Visualization**
   - Should implement track-based visualization similar to genome browsers
   - Should provide multi-scale navigation between document overview and detailed views
   - Should support visual alignment of textual "sequences"

2. **Enhanced Analysis Algorithms**
   - Should incorporate adapted sequence alignment algorithms from bioinformatics
